    "#### Haiku Detector\n",
    "Haikus have been around for centuries, this Japanese form of poetry originally consisted of nature themed short poems, which were exactly 17 phonemes long. These 17 phonemes are then divided over three lines, following a 5, 7, 5 pattern. Haikus by modern writers often do not include nature as a theme, but rather emphasize the funny and unexpected charm of a well-written haiku. This code takes modern song lyrics and aims to detect haikus with unexpected charm hidden within the lyrics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Popular packages such as nltk and syllapy are used in order to recognize the amount of syllables in lyrics, and match them to 5-7-5 syllable pattern. Any detected haikus will then be returned as output.\n",
